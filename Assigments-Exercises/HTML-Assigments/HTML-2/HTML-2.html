        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Daniel Mark S. Dalit, a freshman student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Manila.
        To be honest, I don't have enough knowledge in coding, as my strand in Senior High School was HUMSS, which is not aligned with the course that I am taking right now.
        However, I am very much willing to learn and grow to be able to become skillful in this path that I am taking.
    </p>
    <h2>
